## Introduction
Hello,  
  My name is Kong Pheng Thao and my major is computer science. This README.md is a collection of my work and achievements. through this ReadMe.md, you will get a sense of my skills, experience, and passion for coding. 
  
  I've always been interested in coding ever since I was in high school and I was introduced to it in my engineering class. Though it might not have been much at the time, learning and making code to have a robot move a certain way definitely helped me understand more of the nuances of how a program influences an object in the real world. On top of this, growing up in the technological advancement era in which mobile devices and computers became more prominent helped define my interest in websites, graphical design, and any backend work that goes into making these things work.
  
  As I took my courses at the University of St. Thomas, I was able to obtain a broader understanding of what coding really is and how it's used - not to mention all the math and logic that applies to it. As such, these next couple of projects will help introduce the things I've learned throughout the years.
  
  ## Shading and Illumination
  
  This project that I worked on with another student is from a computer graphics course I took in Spring 2022. This was created using some starter code to learn about how Gourand and Phong shading worked in addition to learning how HTML's WebGL2 API helped with this process. 
  
  In this project, we were to create objects in a 3-Dimensional environment; these objects are very basic objects ranging from spheres to rectangular prisms. On top of this, we also have a light source that can be placed wherever the programmer wanted it to be. Once the environment is built, our main task is to understand how to move the camera around these objects and used what we learned about Gourand and Phong shading to show how they differed from each other, and show this while running the program.

  ## Dynamic Webserver
  
  This is a project that I worked with 2 other students in my web development course. This project is to help students understand how to create, connect, and retreive data from an API and display it on a webserver. 
  
  One of the many of the things that we encountered on the assignment suggested to us that creating templates of HTML pages would contribute greatly to our efficiency. As such, we decided to implement a template engine to create reusable HTML templates. This allowed us to create a consistent layout and design for our server, while also reducing the amount of code we had to write. By using templates, we were able to more easily make updates and changes to the design and layout of our server.
  
  Overall, the use of templates greatly contributed to the success of our project. They allowed us to work more efficiently and effectively as a team, and helped us to deliver a high-quality server that met our goals.

  ## Hamming Code Bit Manipulation
  
  This is an assignment from a computer architecture course. This assignment is to help the student understand how it worked. To complete this assignment, we first learned about the principles of error detection and correction in computer systems. This included understanding how errors can occur during data transmission and storage, and how to detect and correct these errors using techniques such as parity checking and hamming codes.

Once we had a solid understanding of the theory behind error detection and correction, we moved on to implementing these concepts in practice. This involved writing code to manipulate bits according to the rules of hamming codes, and testing our code to ensure that it was correctly detecting and correcting errors.

Working on this assignment required a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. We had to understand the underlying concepts of error detection and correction, as well as be able to apply those concepts through coding. By the end of the assignment, we had a deep understanding of how hamming codes work and how they can be used to improve the reliability of data transmission and storage in computer systems.
