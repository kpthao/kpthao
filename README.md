## Introduction
Hello,  
  My name is Kong Pheng Thao and my major is computer science. This ReadMe.md is a collection of my work and achievements. through this ReadMe.md, you will get a sense of my skills, experience, and passion for coding. 
  
  I've always been interested in coding ever since I was in high school and I was introduced to it in my engineering class. Though it might not have been much at the time, learning and making code to have a robot move a certain way definitely helped me understand more of the nuances of how a program influences an object in the real world. On top of this, growing up in the technological advancement era in which mobile devices and computers became more prominent helped define my interest in websites, graphical design, and any backend work that goes into making these things work.
  
  As I took my courses at the University of St. Thomas, I was able to obtain a broader understanding of what coding really is and how it's used - not to mention all the math and logic that applies to it. As such, these next couple of projects will help introduce the things I've learned throughout the years.
  
  ## Shading and Illumination
  
  This project that I worked on with another student is from a computer graphics course I took in Spring 2022. This was created using some starter code to learn about how Gourand and Phong shading worked in addition to learning how HTML's WebGL2 API helped with this process. 
  
  In this project, we were to create objects in a 3-Dimensional environment; these objects are very basic objects ranging from spheres to rectangular prisms. On top of this, we also have a light source that can be placed wherever the programmer wanted it to be. Once the environment is built, our main task is to understand how to move the camera around these objects and used what we learned about Gourand and Phong shading to show how they differed from each other, and show this while running the program.
