Hello, 
  Welcome to my e-portfolio! My name is Kong Pheng Thao and I am a computer science major. This e-portfolio is a collection of my work and 
  achievements, and I am excited to share them with you. Through this portfolio, you will get a sense of my skills, experience, and passion 
  for coding. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about me.
  
  The University of St. Thomas's vision statement is as follows, "Inspired by Catholic intellectual tradition, the University of St. Thomas 
  educates students to be morally responsible leaders who think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good." Throughout, the
  years that I've been at St. Thomas there's been many projects that embodies this statement in one way or another. Out of the many projects I've done, 
  I'll focus on a few of them and describe how they either focus on the vision statement or my interest in coding.
