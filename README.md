## Introduction
Hello,  
  My name is Kong Pheng Thao and I am a computer science major. This README.md is a collection of my work and achievements. Through this ReadMe.md, you will get a sense of my skills, experience, and passion for coding.

I have always been interested in coding since high school, when I was introduced to it in my engineering class. Although it may not have been much at the time, learning and coding to have a robot move a certain way definitely helped me understand more about how a program can influence an object in the real world. In addition, growing up in an era of technological advancement, where mobile devices and computers became more prominent, helped shape my interest in websites, graphic design, and any backend work that goes into making these things work.

As I took courses at the University of St. Thomas, I was able to gain a broader understanding of what coding is and how it is used, not to mention all the math and logic that applies to it. The following projects will help introduce the things I have learned over the years.
  
  ## Shading and Illumination
  
  This project that I worked on with another student is from a computer graphics course I took in Spring 2022. It was created using some starter code to learn about how Gouraud and Phong shading worked in addition to learning how HTML's WebGL2 API helped with this process.

In this project, we were to create objects in a 3D environment; these objects were very basic, ranging from spheres to rectangular prisms. On top of this, we also had a light source that could be placed wherever the programmer wanted it to be. Once the environment was built, our main task was to understand how to move the camera around these objects and use what we learned about Gouraud and Phong shading to show how they differed from each other, and demonstrate this while running the program.

  ## Dynamic Webserver
  
  This is a project that I worked on with two other students in my web development course. The goal of this project was to help students understand how to create, connect, and retrieve data from an API and display it on a web server.

One of the many things we encountered during the assignment was the suggestion to create templates of HTML pages to improve efficiency. We decided to implement a template engine to create reusable HTML templates, which allowed us to create a consistent layout and design for our server while reducing the amount of code we had to write. Using templates made it easier to make updates and changes to the design and layout of our server.

Overall, the use of templates greatly contributed to the success of our project. They allowed us to work more efficiently and effectively as a team, and helped us deliver a high-quality server that met our goals.

  ## Hamming Code Bit Manipulation
  
  This is an assignment from a computer architecture course. This assignment is to help the student understand how it worked. To complete this assignment, we first learned about the principles of error detection and correction in computer systems. This included understanding how errors can occur during data transmission and storage, and how to detect and correct these errors using techniques such as parity checking and hamming codes.

Once we had a solid understanding of the theory behind error detection and correction, we moved on to implementing these concepts in practice. This involved writing code to manipulate bits according to the rules of hamming codes, and testing our code to ensure that it was correctly detecting and correcting errors.

Working on this assignment required a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. We had to understand the underlying concepts of error detection and correction, as well as be able to apply those concepts through coding. By the end of the assignment, we had a deep understanding of how hamming codes work and how they can be used to improve the reliability of data transmission and storage in computer systems.
